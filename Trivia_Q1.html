          This study is being done by Dr. Bria Long from UC San Diego and associated graduate students in Experimental Methods course. \
          You were selected to participate in this study because you are an adult in the U.S. and have been a represented population in previous psychology studies. \
          The purpose of this study is to better understand how well previously published studies in the psychological field replicate online and with different populations. \
          Your participation in this research should last approximately 5-30 minutes.  If you agree to take part in this study, you may be asked to view a set of stimuli, \
          including pictures, sounds, written text, or videos and then giving some responses via key-presses, verbally, or with paper-and-pencil. We may also observe your \
          choices or preferences among an array of stimuli.  These stimuli will be taken directly from or closely adapted from studies that already exist in the published \
          psychological literature. Stimuli will include, e.g., pictures of objects and human faces, audio and video clips, short text passages, etc. None of the stimuli \
          will be disturbing, threatening, or offensive. The online and in-person experiments described in this protocol will take no more than 30 minutes. An example game \
          you might play would be to click on an image on the screen that matches a word you hear being said out loud. Your total expected time commitment for this study is \
          between 5-30 minutes, and is specified in the study description.</p>"].join(' '),

            be accessible to qualified lab personnel. We will be keeping data collected as part of this experiment indefinitely. This anonymized data (containing neither Prolific \
